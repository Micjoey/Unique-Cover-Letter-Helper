From our company's inception building the TASER to a full suite of hardware and software solutions, we are focused on providing police agencies with state-of-the-art devices and services they need to successfully serve and protect us. In the next few years, we're going to eliminate the burden of paperwork in policing, so officers can increase the time they spend building relationships and serving in their communities. We’ll put video at the heart of police records so our justice system can get to the truth faster. And we won't stop innovating until the bullet is rendered obsolete.\n\nIt’s a big mission, but it’s one we’ll pursue relentlessly every single day.\n\nLocation: Seattle, WA or Scottsdale, AZ\n\nYour Impact\nWe believe that drone technology has the potential to revolutionize public safety and create better outcomes for communities and agencies alike. At Axon Air, we are bringing together the right hardware, software, training, and ethical guidelines to accelerate the adoption and effectiveness of this technology across law enforcement and public safety.\n\nToday, a small but rapidly growing number of agencies are using drones to support search and rescue missions, tactical operations, accident scene reconstruction, and first response. These agencies are cobbling together tools that were built for other industries such as construction or agriculture that don’t meet the needs of a public safety agency. We’re solving that problem with purpose built solutions for law enforcement today with an eye on shaping the use of drone technology in the future.\n\nWe’re a small team with a start-up mentality so we need someone who is flexible and willing to jump in where needed to help us make Axon Air a success. As a Software Engineer on a small team, you will have the ability to work across multiple technology stacks to bring end to end features to our customers. And you get to play with some cool, cutting edge toys while you do it.\n\nSound exciting? Check out this short video to learn more about what we’re building, and apply now to join our team as we make this a reality.\n\nYour Day-to-Day\n\nWriting code to expand the Axon Air line of products, with opportunities in web (frontend and backend) as well as mobile development (iOS and Android)\nCollaborating with internal teams to deeply integrate the Axon Air offering across multiple product lines\nWorking closely with product and design leaders to find the best customer focused solutions\nFlying Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), also known as drones to develop and test new functionality\nBasic Qualifications\n\nDegree in Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, AI, Electrical Engineering, or relevant experience\n3+ years of experience in software engineering\nFull-stack programming experience, having worked with at least one major language such as Scala, Swift, Kotlin, Go, Java, or similar\nExceptional and energetic collaborator within and across the teams\nA scrappy and collaborative do-what-it-takes mentality\nPreferred Qualifications\n\nPart 107 Remote Pilot Certification or Pilot License\nExperience programming across multiple languages\nPrevious experience working on software and hardware integrated solutions\nCompensation and Benefits:\n\nCompetitive salary and 401K with employer match\nDiscretionary paid time off\nRobust parental leave policy\nAn award-winning office/working environment\nRide along with police officers to see them use our technology and get inspired\nAnd more...\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\n\nDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?  \n\n \n\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.\n\nAbout the Role: \nOur Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.\nWe have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.\nSenior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. \nWho We Are Looking For: \nYou have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. \nYou understand engineering fundamentals.At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. \nYou are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.\nYou have a product-focused mindset.  You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.\nYou work with confidence and without ego.Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. \nYou value, seek out, and foster diversity.We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. \nYou are a creative thinker, not bound by "the way things have always been done". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. \nWhat We Care About: \nWhat and how you can contribute is what’s important to us.  Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with.  Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.  What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. \n\nOur culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence. \n\nDoes this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you. \n\nThe Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs.

Come help Karat make every interview predictive, fair and enjoyable.\nThe status quo for technical interviewing doesn’t meet the needs of candidates or hiring companies.

Our competitive product, innovative technology, and experienced team are changing the way real estate investors receive funding for their fix-and-flip and rental properties, transforming the experience from end to end.\n\nThis is a fully virtual/remote position and can be based anywhere in the United States, or Canada through a qualified agency.

In the future we do expect to have plenty of in-person events. We also have offices in San Francisco, CA and Pittsburgh, PA for those of you that live local and want to work from the office.\n\nWhy LendingHome\n\nWe are building a complete real-estate investor platform. First, we became the largest fix-and-flip lender in America. Then, we built a rental property loan product. Most recently, we built a property marketplace to help our customers source their next investment property.\n\nAlong the way we created the world’s most advanced mortgage platform, closing loans 5x faster at 1/3 the cost via automation, alternative credit, and custom loan products. We are in a $500B market and we've grown faster than any of our competitors in the fix-and-flip space. We’ve funded over $5.5B of loans across 27,000+ projects. We have about 40 engineers working on our custom platform spanning loan application, origination, and post-origination. We’ve raised $166M+ in VC from investors like: Foundation Capital, Ribbit Capital, and First Round.\n\nMost lenders are processing mortgages by hand—we are doing it with technology.

It all depends on where you can have the most impact. We have both functional and cross-functional teams. The product-oriented teams are cross-functional and are able to work quickly without taking dependencies in order to deliver the most impact in the shortest amount of time. These cross-functional teams operate like small independent business units with their own goals that align with the company goals. \n\nExperience: You are a proficient software engineer with 5+ years of professional experience.\nProduct focused: You take pride in building high-quality, user-friendly products.\nProblem solver: You excel at understanding and breaking down complex problems. You pay attention to detail.\nGreat communicator: You are candid and honest.
