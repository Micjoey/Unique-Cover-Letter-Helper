Mystery uses human-in-the-loop matching to create a curated outing based on each customer’s unique preferences and price point. Aside from the necessary basic information, Mystery provides limited details on the itinerary—all in an effort to consistently surprise and delight their customers. Throughout the Mystery, customers are guided by Casey, their technology-powered concierge.

We've been building together since 2016 and are trusted by customers including Nike, Airbnb, Slack, Samsung, and more. We're excited to be growing a team as diverse and creative as the millions of people we reach worldwide, and a company where everyone can thrive.\r\rAbout The Role:\rRemember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off.\r\rWhat You'll Do:\rYou'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build an editor for inline mathematical equations.\rYou'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might make it easier to select text across multiple paragraphs.\rYou'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include writing a script to import user feedback into Notion.\rWhat We're Looking For:\rThoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\rShipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.\rFamiliarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.\rPragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\rPut users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\rNot ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\rEmpathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\rTeam player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\rBonus Points:\rYou're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.\rYou've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\rYou have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.","pre_bullet_point_paragraph_one":"","pre_bullet_point_paragraph_two":"","top_skills":"Dynamic and accomplished Software Engineer with experience and expertise in HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Typescript React, Sql, MySql, and Postgres.","bullet_point_one":"Familiarity with working on a team and listening to others, especially when receiving feedback.","bullet_point_two":"Eager to create code that is clean and great functionality that develops a product that the customer loves to use.","bullet_point_three":"","bullet_point_four":"","bullet_point_five":"","bullet_point_six":"","bullet_point_seven":"","bullet_point_eight":"A passion for things that bring energy and positivity to my life.","post_bullet_point_paragraph_one":"","post_bullet_point_paragraph_two":"","modified_date":"2020-11-11","created_date":"2020-09-16"}}

It also makes it dead easy to diagram, draw, or doodle your invention and print it directly to wood, acrylic, fabric, leather, or paper.\r\rOur team is composed of software generalists and we expect you to be one too, but we particularly want your passion and thoughtfulness around front-end web development. While you’ll do lots of things here, you’ll be asked to tackle some of our most challenging UX innovations for the web, and will spread your knowledge and experience through an organization that is eager to learn.

That’s ~$4 Billion of waste in 2019, due largely to a lack of good data and data analytics at commercial scales. Unless we change the status quo, battery cost will remain a major barrier to affordable EVs.\r\rFeasible, Inc. is supporting the clean energy transition by helping batteries be safer, lower cost, and higher performing.

We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.\r\rNuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.\r\rNuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.\r\rYOUR TEAM\rIn Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, an accurate representation of the underlying data, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.\r\rThe Nuna Backend Engineering team is responsible for building the APIs, database schemas and business logic to power our apps. We work with the output of Nuna’s Data Platform, turning large datasets into innovative and highly reliable APIs. Our APIs are bringing new capabilities to healthcare - like understanding the impact of quality improvement in real time on large amounts of data. \r\rWe are building for the long term with a focus on increasing engineer velocity across Nuna by maintaining standardized development and deployment infrastructure tooling for all of Nuna’s application development. We ensure enterprise-grade stability and startup-grade velocity by maintaining a well-tested code base and infrastructure that is secure-by-default.\r\rYOUR IMPACT\rBackend Engineering builds the backbone of every product our users interact with.

Your creativity and intelligence are much more important to us than your experience with our stack.\r\rHow we work\rHappy Customers > Perfect Code. We're out to solve real problems for real people, not to write slick code or play with the hippest frameworks. We spend a lot of time thinking through how to build new features, but the goal is always for the implementation to be maintainable, not for it to be \"pure.\"\r\rVision > GroupThink. A big idea starts in one person's head. We make sure he or she has the space to develop it into a fully-articulated thought before we iterate on it as a group. No brainstorming, no design-by-committee -- these produce watered-down initiatives and incremental ideas.\r\rWriting > Talking. Instead of sitting in meetings, we develop our ideas in writing, asynchronously. Written proposals encourage clearer thought and more thorough deliberation. Our plans are always documented and our culture is remote-friendly.\r\rWhat we're looking for\rWe’d particularly like to get to know you if:\r\ryou communicate with clarity and precision. We care about this almost as much as your technical ability.\ryou're passionate, even if it's not about analytics. There should be something you know more about than anyone on our team.\ryou’ve written 10,000 lines of code that look embarrassing in retrospect. ... and you've written 10,000 lines of good code since then.\ryou like fruit, sunshine, and bad jokes. We aren't robots.\rWhat we're building\rUnder the hood, Heap is powered by node.js, Scala, Spark, ZooKeeper, Kafka, and CitusDB. Our app-layer stack is TypeScript, React, mobx, Redis, and PostgreSQL.\r\rWe're working on:\r\rReal-time infrastructure. We support an expressive set of queries that allow our users to slice and dice their data in arbitrary ways. The results need to come back with sub-second latencies. We also support materializing massive retroactive datasets into our customers' cloud data warehouses. We're working on a new distributed infrastructure to make this possible.\rData capture. We want to provide our users with the richest possible dataset. That means building new integrations (like Android), capturing more semantic data (like A/B test groups), and pulling in data from other sources (like Stripe). All of this has to happen with virtually no performance cost or integration overhead.\rData visualization. Building Heap is as much a design problem as anything else. The most powerful analytics infrastructure in the world doesn't matter if our users can't access that power and understand the results.\r \rOur HQ is in SF, and we have an office in New York, but a large part of our engineering team is remote. We cover relocation costs, and can sponsor visas. We'd love to hear from you, no matter where you are!\r \rHeap has raised $95M in funding from NEA, Y Combinator, Menlo Ventures, SVAngel, Sam Altman, Garry Tan, Alexis Ohanian, Harj Taggar, Ram Shriram, and others.","pre_bullet_point_paragraph_one":"","pre_bullet_point_paragraph_two":"","top_skills":"Dynamic and accomplished Software Engineer with experience and expertise in","bullet_point_one":"","bullet_point_two":"","bullet_point_three":"","bullet_point_four":"","bullet_point_five":"","bullet_point_six":"","bullet_point_seven":"","bullet_point_eight":"","post_bullet_point_paragraph_one":"","post_bullet_point_paragraph_two":"","modified_date":"2020-11-11","created_date":"2020-09-30"}}

That’s why we want all of our Gurus to feel a sense of belonging that comes from feeling supported in all areas of their lives. Everyone has family, friends and interests outside of their careers, so we offer perks and benefits to make work, work better for you.\r\r4 weeks PTO, plus 10 sick days, and holidays. Whether it's hiking to a waterfall in Costa Rica or bonding with your couch, we all need downtime. All Gurus get four weeks paid time off, 10 sick days, and enough holiday to make a banker blush.\rLet's get lunch. Lunches are catered three times per week, and our kitchen stays stocked with a smorgasbord of the team’s most requested snacks and drinks.\rParking is on us. We have your Downtown parking covered.

We now employ gurus in 30 states of the USA as well as in Australia and the UK. For the time being that’s as far as we can go. We won’t bore you with the details, but setting up the extra operations we would need to employ people in new states or countries is a little bit more expensive than replicating your database in another AZ, if you know what we mean. So as much as we would love to have staff in as many countries as we have students, we are only opening this role to applicants in areas we currently have operations.\r\rIf you’re not sure if your US state is included, please still apply! We will let you know if you are in a state that we currently don’t have operations. If anything changes we will reach back out.\r\rWhat’s the interview process like at ACG?\rApplying for a job can feel intimidating and like a full-time job of its own. You shouldn’t have to burn through a week of sick time or all your best out-of-office excuses just to put feelers out for a new career opportunity. We want to be as transparent about the process as possible to help ease your mind. It’s our goal to provide you a fair, efficient interviewing experience that respects you and your time — and to do it all with a sidecar of delight.\r\rOnce you submit an application, we’ll review it. If you’re a good fit, you’ll have an initial chat with a recruiter over the phone. A phone interview with a manager typically follows. Depending on your role, you might then be asked to do a little homework (but nothing too time consuming). Then we’ll schedule a Zoom call to meet other members of the team, answer any questions you have, and give you a feel for what it’s really like to work at ACG. If you're on the fence, just give it a try.\r\rKeep being awesome, Cloud Gurus.\r\rApply for this Job* Required\rFirst Name *\rLast Name *\rEmail *\rPhone\rResume/CV\rAttach Dropbox Google Drive Paste\rCover Letter\rAttach Dropbox Google Drive Paste\rLinkedIn Profile\rWebsite\rAre you authorized to work in the United States for any employer? *\r\rWill you now or in the future require visa sponsorship? *\r\rHelp us maintain an inclusive culture\rWe want anyone, anywhere to have the same chance and opportunity to build a life they love and that they are proud of.

Currently, I am pursuing a newfound passion for becoming a Software Engineer/Software Developer. While driving myself forward in this pursuit, I have formed expertise in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. These skills have launched me into group projects and solo projects to solve different problems or passions. I am enthusiastic about helping others pursue their passions.\r\rIn my previous role as a Research Analyst for the top commercial-residential team that sold over 100+ buildings a year, I helped create, customize, and manage a database of over 70,000+ points of information while reporting directly to the two vice-presidents of the team. In addition to that role, I helped run the marketing and showing for all of our buildings, which required face-to-face interactions with multi-million dollar buyers. \r\rCurrently, I have been diving into my solo projects, where I attempt to take ideas or problems that I am passionate about and solve them with coding and analytics. One of my recent projects used Test Driven Development in Django to help assist me with creating dynamic cover letters that are unique and personalized to every company. \r\rWhen I am not working on passion learning projects, you will find me pursuing other passions - Skiing, Cooking, and soccer. To make myself better in soccer, I have been training to run a 10k with the ultimate goal of working my way to running a marathon.\r\rI also like meeting new people over a cup of coffee.

Equally concerning, about two thirds of youth and young adults with diagnosable depression or anxiety do not receive any counseling or support. Today, there are simply too many barriers to mental health care.\r\r‍Fortunately, there is an extensive body of research that instructs us how to help developing minds learn to manage stress, regulate emotions, cope with anxiety and depression, and be more resilient. And, because most lifetime mental health conditions emerge between ages 13 and 24, this is the best time to teach these life-long mental health skills.\r\rUpLift is an early-stage startup with a vision to create a new model for mental health care, designed specifically for youth and young adults, that integrates the benefits of one-on-one therapy sessions with a mobile app-based experience. Our approach is evidence-based, skills-focused and personalized for each individual client.\r\rOur founding team brings together experts in startup business development, software development, and clinical psychology. We are currently looking to hire our third software developer.\r\r \r\rDescription:\r\rAt UpLift we are building tools that integrate care for our clients and therapists. Clients have a mobile application where they participate in one-on-one sessions with their therapists and learn and practice skills. UpLift Therapists have convenient access to their clients’ assessment and skill progress data, as well as plans for treatment, notes, and more. These tools help our therapists be great and allows us to deliver consistent, evidence-based care to our clients.\r\rWe are looking for a software developer who is a generalist and wants to build tools for our youth and young adult clients and our therapists. The ideal candidate will be able and interested in working across many parts of our code base. You will implement UI based on the screens created by our designer, build the backend endpoints to support your features and interact with data stores, and you may also have opportunities to build out new infrastructure.\r\rWe have a Python Flask backend, use Next.js and React for our front-end service, have a React Native mobile app, and use a variety of AWS services, including ECS, ECR, EC2, RDS, and ALB. We manage most of our infrastructure with Terraform.\r\r \r\rThis job might be for you if you want to...\r\rDesign, implement, and test features for our websites and our mobile applications targeted at different users (e.g., clients, parents, and therapists). This includes a significant amount of UI implementation and styling.\rImplement the backend portions of features through database design and design, implementation, and testing of backend endpoints.\rMaintain service infrastructure and help improve the reliability of our software.\r \r\rThis job might be for you if you have… \r\rThe ability and desire to learn new technologies and tools. Preferably, you have some experience in the tools and technologies we use or other related experience that will speed your acclimation to our code.\rLeadership qualities. As an experienced developer on our team, you will help make important architectural decisions. You will also have a big impact on hiring decisions for our team, as well as helping grow junior developers we may hire in the future.\rThe outlook of a generalist. You are willing and excited to work on all parts of the site. We have a lot of user-facing features with UI to deliver, plenty of backend work, and a need to add instrumentation to our features to track engagement. We will have a high bar for UI polish, particularly in our mobile applications.\rGreat communication skills. With a small team like ours where everything is moving fast, it's easy to get out of sync with each other. We all need to counteract that by communicating with each other frequently and clearly. Furthermore, we all currently work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. \rThe ability to work independently. Your communication skills are complemented by your ability to run with a task and make progress independently, with appropriate check ins.\rA pragmatic attitude. Not everything we build will be perfect. We want to build great software, but our primary goals are to help our clients and to build a sustainable business.

Today, Zymo Research is a multi-million dollar company with its headquarters based in Irvine, California. In addition to its California headquarters, Zymo Research has two international branches located in Freiburg, Germany and Beijing, China.

They carved out a niche in this market by being an early adopter in the field of epigenetics and by offering a high-quality product. They are considered the leader in this market space. One of the keys to Zymo's success in the past 25 years has been their ability to listen to their customers and react quickly. Their tagline \"The Beauty of Science is to Make Things Simple\" is a mantra that is reflected in every one of their products. From epigenetics to RNA/DNA isolation, each product is designed to be both simple in use and robust in its performance.\r\rInside Zymo Research\r\rZymo Research's core beliefs are based on innovation, quality, and customer service. These three paradigms are ingrained in their company culture. They believe their products are the most reliable and uphold to the highest standards of quality in the industry as evidenced by their ISO 9001 certification. They have also received Frost & Sullivan's Best Practices Award for Leadership in Epigenetics Product Quality.\r\rOUR MISSION\rTo provide the most reliable, innovative, and valuable biomedical tools and services to our customers through research and strategic development.\r\rOUR VISION\rTo have a positive impact in the biomedical field and to contribute to the greater good of humanity.\r\rGOLDEN RULE\r\" Treat others as you would like to be treated \" .

We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.\r\rNuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.\r\rNuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies, health plans, and employers, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.\r\rYOUR TEAM\rIn Nuna Engineering, we build technology to enable users (from data scientists to analysts to policy-makers) to understand healthcare data while ensuring its integrity, security and privacy. Our work runs the gamut from joining streams of messy real-world data to building queryable data warehouses to constructing visualizations and dashboards that provide actionable insight. We build systems that are auditable, as automated as possible, an accurate representation of the underlying data, and, most importantly, responsive to our end users' needs. We strive for a creative, collaborative engineering environment that implements best practices of peer review, readability, maintainability, and security of the code base and infrastructure.\r\rThe Nuna Backend Engineering team is responsible for building the APIs, database schemas and business logic to power our apps. We work with the output of Nuna’s Data Platform, turning large datasets into innovative and highly reliable APIs. Our APIs are bringing new capabilities to healthcare - like understanding the impact of quality improvement in real time on large amounts of data. \r\rWe are building for the long term with a focus on increasing engineer velocity across Nuna by maintaining standardized development and deployment infrastructure tooling for all of Nuna’s application development. We ensure enterprise-grade stability and startup-grade velocity by maintaining a well-tested code base and infrastructure that is secure-by-default.\r\rYOUR IMPACT\rBackend Engineering builds the backbone of every product our users interact with. We measure our products’ success by how much they improve care and lower costs. As an engineering-led culture, you will be at the vanguard of making healthcare work for all Americans. Today, you’ll be helping hospitals improve quality of care, enabling health plans to pay for quality-of-care not quantity-of-care, and matching patients to optimal doctors. Tomorrow, you’ll be creating even bigger and better products to shape this industry.\r\rYOUR OPPORTUNITIES\rYou’ll build products that change the dynamics and incentives of the healthcare industry, changing a zero-sum game of competition between payers and providers into patient-centered collaboration.\rYou’ll put data science magic (like predictive analytics and dynamic modeling) into our users’ hands through interactive features in collaboration with the Data Engineering & Data Science teams. \rYou’ll design APIs and service architectures that multiply the effectiveness of internal and external developers serving millions of patients.\rYou’ll manage our high stakes production environment, ensuring high availability/low latency and protecting our sensitive data with rigorous security.\rYou’ll identify big opportunities to improve our technology and our products, blazing trails through ambiguity.\rYou’ll mentor more junior engineers and, in turn, learn from more senior engineers, because we are learners, not knowers, and growing Nuna’s people is the most reliable way to scale our impact.\rYou’ll work as part of a team, not in a silo. At Nuna we rise by lifting others\rYOU BRING\rAs a backend engineering team, we need a wide array of skills as a whole. No single engineer needs to cover every single dimension, so don’t take this as a literal requirements checklist.

We have also built something even stronger and more valuable: an award-winning culture based on trust, empathy, collaboration, and ownership. By working together across typical dividing lines, we are better as a team than any of us could be apart.\r\rDo you have a passion for solving hard problems at scale? Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?  \r\r \r\rCome and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.\r\rAbout the Role: \rOur Engineers are end-to-end owners. You will participate actively in all aspects of designing, building, and delivering products for our clients.\rWe have dozens of individual, mission-focused teams working across a wide spectrum of technological challenges. You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.\rSenior Engineers contribute to more than our product – they build up our team. Through a combination of mentoring, technical leadership, and/or direct management of small teams, they make others better and raise the bar for those around them. \rWho We Are Looking For: \rYou have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects. You think beyond just the task at hand to deeply understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. \rYou understand engineering fundamentals.At our scale, many off-the-shelf techniques and existing technologies (open source and enterprise) simply don't work. You are able to work from first principles to evaluate solutions and adapt them to a unique environment. \rYou are a broadly skilled engineer, accustomed to developing web services. You have experience building always-on systems, working across a variety of technologies and service layers.\rYou have a product-focused mindset.  You have the passion and ability to contribute to the process of discovering what will delight our clients and push forward one of the world’s largest and most influential industries toward a vision of openness, transparency, and evidence-based decision-making.\rYou work with confidence and without ego.Our engineers have deep knowledge and exercise a high degree of leadership in their daily work. You have strongly-held, defensible ideas, and advocate for what you believe is right. You are also adept at identifying and evaluating trade-offs, willing to be proven wrong, and quick to walk through fire to support your fellow teammates. \rYou value, seek out, and foster diversity.We are a global team from many diverse backgrounds, with different experiences and perspectives. To complement this team, you will welcome ideas that are different from your own and be skilled at finding and building from common ground. \rYou are a creative thinker, not bound by \"the way things have always been done\". What you know is less important than how well you learn and innovate. We don't need engineers who know all the answers; we need engineers who can invent the answers no one has thought of yet, to the questions yet to be asked. \rWhat We Care About: \rWhat and how you can contribute is what’s important to us.  Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with.  Variety of technical challenge is one of the best things about working at The Trade Desk as an engineer, but we do not expect you to know every technology we use when you start.  What we care about is that you can learn quickly and solve complex problems using the best tools for the job. \r\rOur culture runs much deeper than just having fun together (though, we do that well too...) – the people we want on our team are trust-builders, generous givers, scrappy problem solvers, and gritty pursuers of excellence. \r\rDoes this sound like you? If so, we welcome your application and the chance to meet you. \r\rThe Trade Desk does not accept unsolicited resumes from search firm recruiters. Fees will not be paid in the event a candidate submitted by a recruiter without an agreement in place is hired; such resumes will be deemed the sole property of The Trade Desk. The Trade Desk is an equal opportunity employer. All aspects of employment will be based on merit, competence, performance, and business needs.

We do this through a community of Interview Engineers who are equipped with Karat's interviewing platform, battle-tested questions, and data-informed best practices. \r\rThe result is highly predictive and fair interviews at scale that candidates truly enjoy. Karat has amassed the largest and most robust dataset of structured interview intelligence to produce never-before-seen hiring analytics. \r\rAs the world continues to transition to virtual work, and the fairness of hiring practices in the tech industry come under greater scrutiny, Karat is uniquely positioned to be a valuable, strategic partner as companies transition to 100% remote hiring.\r\rFounded in 2014, Karat is a privately held and venture-funded company based in Seattle.\r\rEngineering at Karat\rAs a member of Karat's engineering team, you will work on an exciting mission with a highly collaborative team that feels like family.

Guided by a mission to accelerate the world’s research, Academia aims to make every academic paper ever published available for free online and accessible by anyone in the world.\r\rAcademia has built a network of Academics around the world who access our platform on the web and a native mobile app to discover new research, collaborate, recommend and peer review papers, and gather feedback on draft research by participating in real-time collaborative sessions. Academia’s platform has registered more than 130 million users (growing at over 150,000 per day), has over 70 million unique visitors every month, including over 19M logged-in monthly active users (MAU). We have over 150,000 paying premium subscribers, which has contributed to a doubling in revenue for both of the last two years.\r\rAcademia has attracted $34 million in investment from leading VC firms including Khosla Ventures, True Ventures, Spark Capital, and Tencent. Our work has garnered favorable attention from trade and mainstream media including UK Times, Fortune, Wired, EdTech, Venture Beat, San Francisco Business Times, The Economist, The Washington Post, TechCrunch, Scientific American, and Forbes.\r\rAcademia is a proud equal opportunity employer and we are committed to hiring and supporting a diverse workforce. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\r\rTechnologies we use Ruby on Rails, React (to make our FE more responsive), RSpec and Jasmine for testing, PostgreSQL for data storage, Redis for in-memory data structures, Elasticsearch for our full-text search engine, Kafka for our publish-subscribe messaging, Neo4J for managing our email lists, all working with EC2 spot instances and autoscaling, and Ansible for configuration management.\r\rRequirements Solid CS fundamentals; Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science or related major strongly preferred Preferably 2-5+ years of large scale web application development in a Unix/Linux environment. Strong knowledge of web services architecture, and the ability to quickly learn new technologies Proficiency with Ruby, Python, or other scripting language is preferred but not required Understanding, creating and manipulating and querying databases API/back-end coding in one or more languages e.g. Ruby, Java, Python, etc. Front-end coding experience in one or more languages, e.g. HTML, JavaScript, Java, etc., is preferred but not required.\r\rAbout Academia.edu\rAcademia is building a new distribution and peer review platform. Our mission is to accelerate the world’s research and make every academic publication available for free to anyone, anywhere, in any language, and in any format and by doing so, advance the pace of scientific progress.\r\rAcademia.edu was founded in 2008 in San Francisco by ​Richard Price​ who recognized the need for open access to scholarly work while he was a doctoral candidate in philosophy at Oxford University.\r\rAcademia has built a network of Academics around the world who access our platform on the web and via native mobile apps to discover new research, collaborate, recommend and peer review papers, and gather feedback on draft research by participating in real-time collaborative sessions.\r\rAcademia’s platform has more than 142 million registered users (growing at over 150,000 per day), has over 65 million unique visitors every month. We have over 280,000 paying premium subscribers, which has contributed to us doubling in revenue for both of the last two years.\r\rHistorically, Academic journals have controlled the publishing process. Usually, 2 peer reviewers evaluate the quality of a paper, and either reject it or approve it. It is then published by the journal and is put behind a paywall. It typically costs $50-$100 to get the paper out from the paywall. The process of submitting to publishing usually takes a minimum of 12-months or longer.\r\rAcademia’s mission is to disrupt this $10B industry.\r\rWe’re located ~3 blocks from Montgomery BART in downtown San Francisco.\r\rWe’re a Ruby on Rails shop, with React on the frontend our native mobile apps are built for iOS with Swift and Android using Kotlin. All of our engineers are full-stack, and virtually all of them are computer scientists.

We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status.\r\rCompany Culture\rWe run an open, transparent, and collaborative company. If our CEO gives a board presentation then the next day he'll show the same deck to all employees. Cash flow and product plans are openly shown to everyone.

We work with over 5,000 real estate agents, and have saved homeowners thousands on commissions across the country. We participated in Capital Innovators in the fall of 2017, and have since raised $5.25 million. Thousands of homeowners have chosen clever since 2017, and we’re excited to help tens of thousands in the next few years. \r\rClever connects home buyers and sellers with experienced, local real estate agents — and helps everyone out in the process.\r\rBuyers and sellers receive the full service and support of a top agent in their area and benefit from cost-savings, like discounted commission rates.\r\rFor top real estate agents, Clever provides a constant stream of qualified buyers and sellers. We save agents thousands on marketing costs, and let them focus on what they do best — helping their clients buy and sell homes.clever review\r\rAs Clever continues to grow and develop, we’re excited for what’s ahead. We know that people are our biggest advantage, and we’ll continue investing in our team members and their professional development. We’re committed to creating strong bonds and an inclusive culture for our team.\r\rOur Engineering team is hiring two Fullstack Engineers. (remote)\r\rBelow, I'll share a few things about the company and the position.\r\rHow does Clever make money?\rWe connect customers to real estate agents and help them save money in the process (sellers get a discount on commission, buyers get a rebate on their home purchase). When a customer buys/sells a home, we get a percentage of the real estate agent's revenue in exchange for having sent them the customer.\r\rWhat makes Clever unique? (What is defensible?)\r\rOur secret sauce has two parts and is centered around providing a seamless customer experience.\r\rOur Secret Sauce Recipe\rOur in-house Concierge Team provides a seamless customer experience that our competitors simply don't have.\rOur proprietary technology allows our Concierge Team to provide this seamless experience at scale.\rIn that way, we're a lot like StitchFix. They have amazing stylists, and they have lots of tech and automation behind the scenes that allows them to scale the experience. We apply the same ideas to matching our customers with the right real estate agent.\r\rThe Concierge Team\rBefore being matched with agents, customers talk to folks on the Concierge Team. These folks are a resource for answering customer questions about real estate and setting expectations about the home buying / selling process.\r\rThere's a lot of regulation about what can and cannot be said to customers about real estate (especially around commissions), so each concierge has to become a licensed real estate agent themselves. There's no way around it: that's a lot of work. We do it, and our competitors don't. As a result, we can provide a much better experience to our customers.\r\rThe Technology: Our proprietary Agent Matching Platform (AMP⚡)\rWe believe that every homeowner's situation is unique and deserves the attention of a trained and caring concierge. We also believe in the power of technology to augment our team's abilities.\r\rWith our Agent Matching Platform (or AMP) at their sides, our Concierge Team can quickly and easily navigate thousands of data points about the 8K real estate agents on our platform.\r\rThe goal is not to automate the Concierge experience, but rather: to scale it through the use of technology.\r\rOur customers love our Concierge Team, and the AMP allows lets us deliver this high-touch experience to thousands of customers with a relatively small in-house team.\r\rWhat are Clever's values?\rWe are a highly collaborative team that values pair-programming, a growth mindset, and end-to-end ownership of initiatives.\r\rWe value learning together. We regularly teach each other new things through Learning Sessions.\r\rWe believe that engineering is a team sport. We all participate in DevOps, and we strive to eliminate single points of failure by sharing context. We don't like hero ball; instead, we prefer to tackle problems together.\r\rWe have a culture of blame-free continuous improvement.\r\rWhat is Clever hiring for?\rWe're looking for a frontend engineer to help us maintain our web properties using both react and wordpress.\r\rWe are looking for someone who values collaboration and has strong communication skills.\r\rOur ideal engineer is someone who enjoys pair programming, thinking through decisions together, and breaking down problems to solve them iteratively.\r\rOur onboarding process involves a lot of pairing, so we'll get you up to speed on our tech stack.\r\rWe're interested in mid-level or senior engineers.\r\rWhat will onboarding look like?\rIn your first month, you'll do a lot of pair programming with existing members of our team. The goal is to familiarize you with our existing systems and build relationships with the team. If you're unfamiliar with any of our technologies, we'll begin ramping you up on them. By the end of the first 30 days, you'll be able to tackle small bugs and features independently, and you'll know who to ask for help from when stuck. You'll also learn how our testing and deployment processes work. You'll meet with stakeholders and teammates from outside of Engineering to get to know them and understand their workflows.\r\rIn your second month, you'll begin working more independently and proposing implementations for small features. You'll perform root-cause analysis for bugs independently, escalating to other teammates when you need a second set of eyes. With your newfound understanding of our codebase and systems, you'll be able to ask clarifying questions about tickets in our backlog, refining upcoming work before it's planned into a sprint. You'll use your understanding of our Concierge team's workflows to better debug problems and understand the business impact that changes will have.\r\rBy the end of your third month, you'll be fully ramped up. You'll participate in the speccing process for new features and epics on our roadmap, and you'll help others resolve issues when they have questions about certain parts of the codebase that you've gained familiarity with. You'll have established strong working relationships with folks inside and outside of Engineering, and you'll have a clear understanding of both our customer journey and the workflows of our internal stakeholders. You'll use the business context you've picked up to discuss the priority of features and bugs in the backlog. You may find yourself advocating for a new tool that will help us perform root-cause analysis more easily when issues come up.\r\rAbout Clever Real Estate\rWe help folks save money on real estate commissions while connecting them with the best real estate agents in their area.\r\rOur concierge team of licensed real estate experts answers customers' questions, offer advice, and learn exactly what they're looking for in an agent. We decide which agents to recommend based on customers' specific goals and needs. They get to meet each agent and decide which one they'd like to work with. They can also request to be introduced to more agents if they don't feel they've found a fit.\r\rIn all cases, our service is completely free for customers. We make money by taking a percentage of the commission made by the real estate agent. Agents happily pay this in exchange for the consistent deal-flow that we send their way.\r\rSince our inception in 2017 we've helped homeowners buy and sell over a billion dollars in real estate, while saving over $25,000,000 in real estate fees.\r\rWe've built a product that helps consumers save thousands, while providing a consistent source of business for great agents.\r\rCompany Culture\rWe believe in shipping code frequently and measuring outcomes. We take a validated-learning approach to writing code.\r\rWe value having a bias towards action and a drive for documenting your work.\r\rWe love pair programming for sharing context, and we regularly invoke swarming — or, flash collaboration — to unblock each other. We believe that the improvement of daily work is work, and it should be at the forefront of our minds all of the time.\r\r———\r\rHere's an excerpt from our Blameless Post-Mortem template that is particularly illustrative of our team culture:\r\rRemember: We're trying to prepare for a future where we're as humanly fallible as we are today. It's not productive for us to come out of this meeting with a decision tobe less stupidorbe more careful\". Rather, we should try to identify fool-proof countermeasures that we can use to avoid issues in the future. This may involve an automated system or a documented process that captures organizational learning.\r\rWe should explicitly disallow the phrases would have and could have. It's much more productive to think about why we chose a course of action and what we'll do in the future to improve our incident prevention and response practices.\r\rFinally, remember that this meeting is not about naming, blaming, and shaming others. It's about improving ourselves as a team.\"\r\rABOUT\rMANIFESTO\rOPEN SOURCE DONATIONS\rSOFTWARE ENGINEER SALARY\rSOFTWARE ENGINEERING JOBS\rDIVERSITY\rPRESS\rFAQ\rBLOG\rCONTACT\rCAREERS\rPrivacy Center\rPrivacy Policy\rTerms and Conditions","pre_bullet_point_paragraph_one":"","pre_bullet_point_paragraph_two":"","top_skills":"Dynamic and accomplished Software Engineer with experience and expertise in Python, Django, PostgreSQL, React and JavaScript.","bullet_point_one":"Over the last five years, I have worked in multiple team-based, customer-oriented, professional roles.","bullet_point_two":"For sixteen years on competitive soccer teams, I practiced the art of communicating in a fast moving environment, including four years of college D3 soccer.","bullet_point_three":"My passion for competitive soccer has taught me to learn from my mistakes using constructive feedback to improve future action.","bullet_point_four":"I continually strive for opportunities to improve my skills and have the opportunity to problem-solve.","bullet_point_five":"A passion for reading books on communication, relationship building, and leadership allow me to learn continually.","bullet_point_six":"","bullet_point_seven":"","bullet_point_eight":"","post_bullet_point_paragraph_one":"","post_bullet_point_paragraph_two":"","modified_date":"2020-11-17","created_date":"2020-11-17"}}

By contrast, Render makes it easy to get up and running quickly but also allows applications to scale and increase in complexity over time, preventing a transition to DIY infrastructure.\r\rOur goal is to completely free up developers and teams from managing infrastructure. This will ultimately improve all software and enable entirely new kinds of applications.\r\rWe're building products that abstract over complexity and minimize cognitive overhead for our customers. This requires careful thought, high creativity and a deep understanding of application requirements in production. We believe that the best UX is invisible, and we strive to exceed customer expectations with a product that is incredibly intuitive and delightful, even in the tiniest of details. We're looking for engineers with high integrity, low ego, and an insatiable drive to learn. Our platform serves over a billion requests every month and we have tens of thousands of users including Cypress.io, Bloomscape, NYU, and US presidential campaigns. We have product-market fit and rapidly increasing revenue, and we're backed by the same early stage investors behind Airbnb, Snap, and Stripe.\r\rAs a UX engineer at Render, you will take ownership of the interactions and experiences of tens of thousands of developers as they use our platform. You will build visually appealing and intuitive interfaces that make developers want to use Render even if they don't have a project to host on it.\r\rYou should already have a few years of experience building detailed product interactions and workflows. You should also have a keen understanding of UX design, and extensive experience collaborating with product and design teams in building complex frontend applications in React. Prior experience developing design systems is a plus.\r\rEngineering at Render\rWe're a small team of world-class engineers. We have complete ownership for every project we take on and expect the same from you. We review all major code changes through pull requests, and are always pushing ourselves to do better. We iterate quickly and deploy to production several times a day.\r\rWhy join us\rWe're solving a problem faced by every developer and development team. It's a massive and rapidly growing market (AWS is privately valued at over $200B, and there are over 30 million professional developers globally).\rDelightful UX is the one of the biggest differentiators for Render, and as our first UX engineer you will have tremendous impact on the product and company's trajectory.\rEveryone wants to move their infrastructure to Kubernetes, but it's too complex for the average development team. Render makes it possible to get the power of Kubernetes without any of its complexity.\rTop engineering leaders from VMware, Dropbox, Heroku and GitHub are some of our biggest investors and cheerleaders.\rThe company is led by Anurag Goel, who was employee #8 and Head of Risk at Stripe. He helped Stripe scale from 10 to over 400 people and is applying many of the same principles that helped Stripe succeed to Render.\rWhat you will work on\rYou will work with the design team on Render's website and dashboard, continuously improving their visual appeal and ease of use.\rYou will collaborate with Render engineers to build user interfaces for upcoming products and features.\rYou will create high fidelity prototypes to help find solutions to thorny interaction problems.\rYou will create unit and integration tests for the frontend using tools like Jest and Enzyme, and end-to-end testing pipelines using tools like Cypress (a Render customer!)\rYou will help accelerate the JavaScript to TypeScript migration in our frontend codebase.\rYou will own the observability of user interactions and use this data to drive improvements across the board.\rYou will create a world class onboarding experience for Render users and continue to refine it based on data.\rSome benefits we offer\rComprehensive medical, dental and vision coverage with PPO plans and 100% of your premiums paid by Render.\r99th percentile stock grants and a comfortable San Francisco salary.\rFour weeks paid vacation, and vacation days are only counted when you take more than one at a time.\rWork from home if you have a delivery or chore to take care of.\r3 months paid maternity and paternity leave.\rCommuter benefits including Lyft and SF Muni passes.\rA sunny, beautiful, well-stocked office in SoMa close to Caltrain and BART.\rMonthly gym membership allowance.\rBuild your own laptop/workstation with any peripheral or accessory you need.\rUse the company card to order any work-related ebook or p-book, and buy anything to make your work environment more ergonomic.\rFinancial and logistical assistance to help you relocate to the Bay Area.\rImmigration assistance.\rBirthday celebrations, weekly happy hours, company dinners, and semi-annual team retreats.\rSurprise gifts for the holidays!\rYou are a great fit for this role if\rYou have a few years of professional experience building complex frontend applications and experiences. Bonus points if you’ve excelled at a small, high-growth startup.\rYou have a user-centric mindset and impressive attention to detail.\rYou thrive in a collaborative environment and believe in direct, open and honest communication.\rYou are self-directed, curious by nature and an impressively quick learner.\rYou are unfazed by unfamiliar challenges and enjoy figuring things out on your own.\rBonus points for experience developing design systems and conducting user research.\rThe ideal candidate would check everything above but you should certainly apply if you identify with most of it.\r\rWorking at Render\rWe value high integrity, low ego, an affinity for continuous learning, and the ability to figure things out quickly.
